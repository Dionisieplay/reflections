How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a temporary directory in the memory showing what we want to commit beofre actually commiting the change. It offers a safety net in case we make mistakes.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can see exactly which files are commited and you can see what change your are making using either git diff or git --staged.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Make experimental changes to the project without touching to the main branch of the project you are working on.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps understanding which commit we have access to and which ones are excluded.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

They will share all the changes made by both branches and we'll have access to each branch's commits without having to checkout the branch first.
